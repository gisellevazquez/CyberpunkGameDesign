Now having all these stuff you can write the story, Or iterate (change the ideas, make it better)

Here you can probably ask this questions:&#x20;

* Who are the main characters?
* Whats the objective?&#x20;
* Does V have any need or desire? does other character have?&#x20;
* What's the challenge? (what level is needed? is any perk needed? one more than other?) (like lets say... the location is full of netrunners)
* Whats the reward? (more than the basics points and money... are there easter eggs? relationships progression? artifacts?)
* Is the story lineal? (_plot and multiplot_)

> writers of multi-plot stories (_always limited and censored in their art by numbers people_) try to implement a technique called "author control." This consists of mercifully misleading the audience with paths that seem to lead away from the main trunk of the story, but return fairly quickly. In this graph (üëá), each rectangle represents a sequence or segment of the plot, which branches off, but returns to the central axis. This sharpens the ingenuity to reuse scenes, so that the system shows consistency. Since the vast majority explore only one path, they are unaware of how little different their experience would have been had they strayed down another path.

#### Other concepts:&#x20;

**Environment** ( Setting or World Setting ) : the setting where the narrative takes place , especially in terms of place or location , moment of time and social and cultural context .&#x20;

**In - game artifact** : a narrative piece , often collectible and optional consumption , distributed in a game or participatory format that deepens the story , providing backstory for the characters or setting .&#x20;

**Encounter**: An encounter between a player character and a creature, often to fight each other.&#x20;

**Cutscene** : A narrative sequence , generally brief and non - interactive , distributed throughout the story and serving the purpose of plot progression . It can be represented through multiple formats or ‚Äúnarrative vehicles‚Äù&#x20;

### Character Types:

According to their function, the characters are usually classified as main and secondary and, sometimes, tertiary. The main characters, or protagonists, are those who have a greater involvement in the plot, make the key decisions and, in general, the story is built around them. They are at the heart of action and conflict. In many stories there is more than one protagonist. The secondary have less weight in the plot. In turn, the plot needs at least one conflict to unfold the action of the characters. This requires a force opposed to the protagonist, the antagonist.

* **Protagonist** (the main character chief)
* **Antagonist** (the opposite force to the protagonist)
* Secondary characters
* Tertiary characters
