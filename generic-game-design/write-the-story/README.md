# Write the story

Here, there are some ways to do, one is having a deeper knowledge on writing and storytelling. If you have it, all this process will be quite simple for you.



The other is making brainstormings, create stuff, and "crazy thinking" in this phase nothing is "stupid" "unreal" or not viable.

On this "chapter" we'll explore the what should we consider to create our story, and some techniques.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The next pages are written from the Narrative/Game design perspective, no write techniques or authors are named here.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
