# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

All the info you'll find under this wiki is related to game, level and narrative design, making ideas, and organizing them.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This Wiki is not about "_how to code a level, or a quest_" it explores the design aspect and recopiles info about Cyberpunk world.\
Please note that this Wiki was previously focused on quest design modding, but as a designer, I have shifted the focus towards creating a valuable research resource. The Wiki is dedicated to exploring and learning about the world of Cyberpunk 2077 game design and does **not involve** making changes to the game itself. My mission is to provide an in-depth understanding of the game's design principles and mechanics, making it a valuable tool for anyone interested in game design
{% endhint %}

## Design Principles

This wiki attempts to collect Cyberpunk 2077 information about the Design aspect: game design, world, environment, gameplay, lore, etc.

**The sources of information are:** Official books, Wikis, Documentaries, or other formats that are supported by official sources.&#x20;

## TLDR;  About this wiki:

Explore the design aspect of the Cyberpunk world through this Wiki, where is compiled a wealth of information, without delving into the technicalities of coding levels or quests.
