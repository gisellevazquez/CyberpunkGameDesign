# UI

For a long time I've been working on doing a UI kit for maintain a consistency on Mods, Publications or the same wiki, as a designer I attempt to that, you can visualize the wiki or duplicate the file so you can use it on your own account:

\
This wiki is still on progress, I always add new stuff when I have time
