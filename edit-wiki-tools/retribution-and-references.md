# Retribution & References

## For Text

#### Books, Guides, other wikis

If you copy or upload any text, source, or content related to the game, kindly label it using the APA7 style. I use the [Scribbr citation generator](https://www.scribbr.com/citation/generator/),  but feel free to use other citation tools available

## For Images

If you upload an image created by any developer who has worked with or at CD Projekt Red (CDPR), please include the name and profession of the developer in the caption. This will help in easily identifying and locating the source.

<mark style="color:purple;">Example:</mark> [kitsch.md](../cyberpunk-design-resources/style/kitsch.md "mention")

## Fan Made Sources

For the research to qualify as genuine "_Game Design Research_" it is imperative that all sources are official. This includes materials produced by the developers directly involved in the game's creation or reputable documentaries on the subject.
