# Information Arquitecture

## Separate the Wiki on Categories:&#x20;

* **Generic Game Design**: the information that is not related to the game but it enriches the wiki.
* **Cyberpunk Design resources**: All related to Cyberpunk divided on categories like:&#x20;
  * Quest Design
  * Level Design&#x20;
  * World Setting
  * Other resources

## Only 2 childs:

Redability of the wiki is important, make it easy to people to navigate by only adding:&#x20;

* One trunk category
* One page with Info
* (optional) Use it with caution! if you think there's information that need to have another child (3rd level of category) add one page.&#x20;
