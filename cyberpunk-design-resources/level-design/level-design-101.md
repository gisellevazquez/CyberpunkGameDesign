# Level design 101

So, yes you had written your story and now you need to know where and how your characters will move on it.&#x20;

This can probably change a bit our story but it is fine. We are "iterating" to make the best quest possible.&#x20;

One of the keys to good level design is that the playerâ€™s eyes pull them through the level, effortlessly. It makes the player feel in control and immersed in the world.

Avoid cognitive charge: this means, avoid the player needed to go backwards to find something and then go back.&#x20;
